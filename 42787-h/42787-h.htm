<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ITALIAN ENGLISH.</h3>

  <p>I have been favoured by a friend, who visited Italy last year, with
  the perusal of a small guidebook, which has afforded me much amusement,
  and from which I send you a few extracts for the gratification of your
  readers. The title runs thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Description of the front and interior of the Cathedral of Milan the
  first edition corrected, and increased with interesting things Milan by
  the printer Luigi di Giacomo Pirola <span
  class="sm">M.DCCC.XLVI.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Preface is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In presenting to the learned and intelligent Publick this new and
  brief Description of the Cathedral of Milan, i must apprise that i do not
  mean to emulate with the works already existing of infinite merit for the
  notions they contain, and the perspicuity with which they are exposed. My
  idea only was to make an extract of them, not forgetting the principal
  things of observation, with the names of the most distinguished artists,
  and not to deprive them of all the digressions and explanations required
  by the Scientificals, or those skilled in the art, so that it might be
  contained in a Pamphlet, and of little expence, to be offered to the
  amateurs of fine arts, who come to visit this unique and magnificent
  Edifice. Therefore i have not failed to include in it, all that has been
  done subsequently to the publishment of the above works, with some other
  little trifles worthy to be seen, and in them not mentioned. Such has
  been my sole design, no other pretention has induced me to it, and with a
  similar premise, i hope to be pardoned by the indulgent Reader for all
  the errors in which i might have involuntarily incurred.</p>

  <p class="author">G. P."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the introductory portion, giving a general account of the building,
  "G. P." says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Under the direction of honest, intelligent and active Administrators,
  and by the pious munificence of our Gracious Sovereign, who bestowes an
  annual generous donation for completing the building of the Cathedral of
  Milan, one perceives tending with the greatest celerity to the perfection
  of this magnificent Edifice, founded by a special vow in 1386 by the duke
  of Milan Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti. It is of fine white statuary marble,
  extracted from the quarry of mount Gandolia, which among many gifts was
  expressly regaled for the building by its generous founder the duke
  Visconti above mentioned."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>{150}</span></p>

  <p>In describing the "fore-front" he gives a catalogue of the
  "bass-riliefs," from which a few extracts are made:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1st. the Tobiolo assisted by the Angel in his jounrey to Rages, ...
  the second is the Angel that expells Adam and Eve from the Eden, by Carlo
  Maria Giudici. The two in the second order are: Daniel in the lake of the
  lions by the above Carabelli, and Job on the dunghill, by the above
  Giudici. The two upper Statues that figure Saint Bartholomew and Saint
  James Junior, are works by Buzzi Donelli and Buzzi Giuseppe. The
  Bass-Riliefs that follow aside of the Pilaster is God appearing to Moses
  in the ardent-brambles.... Over the great windout the Bass-Rilief
  representing Samuel while he oints Saul king of Israel is by Carlo Maria
  Giudici, and Angelo Pizzi a milanese, carved the vision of Jacob on the
  side of the following Pilaster. In sight of the same Moses who makes the
  water gush from the mountain is by Giuseppe Buzzi, and the other
  Bass-Rilief that is placed above, represents the prophet Elia presenting
  to the afflicted mother the resurrection of her Son, by Grazioso Rusca.
  By Canaillo Pacetti is the Statue of Saint James senior.... The
  Bass-Rilief over the great window represents the prophetess Debora
  providing captain Barach with arms.... Ornamented is the rest of the
  front with a great number of Statues managed with skill by intelligent
  Authors, and aside of the door are the Apostles Peter and Paul of ancient
  work and unknown Author ... as also of unknown chisel is Saul who tempts
  to kill David.... The Angel who assures Sampson's Father that his Wife,
  believed to be sterile, will generate the strongest of Israel's sons....
  On reaching the fourth door one perceives in the frontispiece the
  Bass-Rilief that adorns it, which is by Lasagni; representing Givele that
  with a nail kills captain Sisara.... Esaù renouncing the primogeniture to
  his brother Jacob.... Over the great window is painted Agar dying with
  thirst, with the son of Ismael in the desert, while an Angel appears
  indicating a fountain to her.... The first of the other four Bass-Riliefs
  in view figure Gedeone preparing to fight the Madianites, and the second
  Sampson suffocating the lion.... The Saints Philip and Thomas placed
  upwards are by the egregious Pompeo Marchesi ... the second is by
  Ribossi, representing Absatom suspended by his hair to a tree and pierced
  through by Jacob."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In describing the interior, "G. P." is rather more instructive, but
  not quite so entertaining: however, a number of the peculiar expressions
  already quoted are repeated with the same confiding simplicity. A few
  extracts will suffice for this portion:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The ornaments of the five doors are the designment of Fabio Mangone,
  ... the surprising vault a <i>chiaro-scuro</i>, drawn and painted in part
  by our milanese Felice Alberti, who in the year 1827 was ravished from
  the living by a fatal misfortune in the flower of his age ... in the
  inward columns on both sides are two very fine Statues sitting in a very
  melancholy action, which represent military Peace and Virtue ... under
  the tomb-stone is another small and genteel Bass-Rilief representing the
  Saviour afflicted, sustained by two little Angels.... The Altar of Santa
  Tecla, which is part of the left arm of the cross, or form of the Church,
  as is mentioned above, representing the Saint in a seraglio of wild
  beasts, is by the Sculptor Carlo Beretta."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Lest I should have exhausted your patience, as well as that of your
  readers, I will close with one more quotation, which displays what Mrs.
  Malaprop calls "a nice derangement of epitaphs:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The last altar that was seen not long since on this side was
  dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whose image carved in wood dated a
  remote antiquity, but as to the remnant nothing was found to be
  appreciable in sort of art."</p>

<h3>ST. NICHOLAS CHURCH, BRIGHTON.</h3>

  <p>In matters touching the public weal, the Editor of "N. &amp; Q."
  always finds space for his correspondents: a few lines are asked for the
  present subject, as being one on which his pages have already been
  earnestly devoted.</p>

  <p>The rebuilding of Brighton old church has been announced, and those
  who have frequented the salubrious breezes of that unequalled marine
  residence have often enjoyed the commanding view of the town and noble
  sea, which is obtained from the hill on which this venerable fabric
  stands, and which is about to disappear and perhaps "leave not a wreck
  behind."</p>

  <p>The church is literally lined and flagged with monuments of the dead,
  more or less noted; but all of whom have passed through the stage of this
  life away from their native localities, and many falling where they went
  to seek in vain renovated health.</p>

  <p>The tombs in the churchyard, immediately adjoining the church, of
  Capt. Tettersell, who conveyed King Charles to France after the battle of
  Worcester; and Ph&oelig;be Hassell, who fought under the Duke of
  Cumberland at Fontenoy, are continually surveyed by the old visitors. In
  a few months it may be too late to suggest to your friends interested in
  the preservation of monumental remains, and their inscriptions, to
  prevent such a similar removal and destruction as has taken place at
  Lambeth, under the walls of the Archbishop's residence, by the rector,
  church-wardens, and architects of Lambeth new church.</p>

  <p>A notice to those interested in the history of the county of Sussex
  may be the means of preserving at least the inscriptions, and calling
  attention of the amiable and respected vicar of Brighton to a
  consideration of the subject.</p>

  vi., p. 208.) by P. C. S. S. Now, the parallel between the two passages
  ("<i>Parallel</i>, resemblance, conformity continued through many
  particulars, likeness," Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>) is this: Both verses
  endeavour to picture the mingled red and white of the "human face divine"
  (one satirically, the other eulogistically), by comparing their combined
  effect to that of the red hue of fruit seen through a partially
  superfused white medium&mdash;meal over mulberries, cream over
  strawberries. If there is not sufficient "resemblance" or "likeness" in
  the two (in the opinion of P. C. S. S.) to justify me in placing them
  <i>alongside of one another</i> (<span title="parallêla" class="grk"

<h3>ANTIQUITY OF THE POLKA: A NOTE FOR THE LADIES.</h3>

  <p>The description of the <i>lavolta</i> in Sir John Davies's poem on
  dancing, <i>The Orchestra</i> (1596), shows that it must have closely
  resembled the dance which we fondly boast of as one of the great
  inventions of the nineteenth century. It runs as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Yet is there one, the most delightful kind,</p>
      <p>A lofty jumping, or a leaping round,</p>
      <p>Where arm in arm two dancers are entwined,</p>
      <p>And whirl themselves with strict embracements bound;</p>
      <p>And still their feet an anapæst do sound;</p>
      <p>An anapæst is all their music's song,</p>
      <p>Whose first two feet are short, and third is long."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The "anapæst" is conclusive; it points exactly to the peculiar nature
  of the polka, the pause on the <i>third</i> step. Moreover, it appears,
  that as there is no especial figure for the polka, so there was none for
  the lavolta; for it is classed among those dances</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Wherein that dancer greatest praise has won,</p>
      <p>Which, with best order, can all orders shun;</p>
      <p>For everywhere he wantonly must range,</p>
      <p>And turn and wind with unexpected change."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Who can doubt after that? The polka was certainly danced before Queen
  Elizabeth!</p>

  <p>To this valuable historical parallel I may add that the galliard and
  coranto also were apparently danced <i>ad libitum</i> (observing only a
  particular measure), just as our waltz and galop also are:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For more diverse and more pleasing show,</p>
      <p>A swift, a <i>wandering</i> dance, he [Love] did invent,</p>
      <p>With <i>passages uncertain</i> to and fro,</p>
      <p>Yet with a certain answer and consent,</p>
      <p>To the quick music of the instrument."</p>

<h3>SEVEN SCORE SUPERSTITIOUS SAYINGS.</h3>

  <p>My common-place books contain a goodly number of superstitious
  sayings, noted down as heard at different times and in various places,
  chiefly during the last ten or twelve years. I have made a selection from
  them, the greater portion of which will probably come under the printer's
  eye for the first time, should they be considered a fitting addition to
  the interesting records of Folk Lore in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." I
  reserve my comment or attempted illustration for future
  opportunities.</p>

<p class="ac"><i>First Score.</i></p>

  <p>1. <i>Adder.</i> "Look under the deaf adder's belly, and you'll find
  marked, in mottled colours, these words:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'If I could hear as well as see,</p>
      <p>No man of life [sic] should master me!'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(This saying was related to me by a friend, a native of Lewes, Sussex,
  where it is common.)</p>

  <p>2. <i>Adder-skin.</i> "It'll bring you good luck to hang an ether-skin
  o'er the chimbly [chimney-piece]." (Heard in Leicestershire.)</p>

  <p>3. <i>Beanfield.</i> "Sleep in a beanfield all night if you want to
  have awful dreams, or go crazy." (In Leicestershire.)</p>

  <p>4. <i>Chime-hours.</i> "A child born in chime-hours will have the
  power to see spirits." (A Somerset friend.)</p>

  <p>5. <i>Egg-shells.</i> "Always poke a hole through your eggshell before
  you throw it away."&mdash;Why? "If you don't, the fairies will put to sea
  to wreck the ships." (Somerset. Query, For fairies, read witches?)</p>

  <p>6. <i>Eyebrows.</i> "It's a good thing to have meeting eyebrows.
  You'll never know trouble." (Various places.)</p>

  <p>7. <i>Fern-root.</i> "Cut a fern-root slantwise, and you'll see a
  picture of an oak-tree: the more perfect, the luckier chance for you."
  (Croydon and elsewhere.)</p>

  <p>8. <i>Flowering Myrtle.</i> "That's the luckiest plant to have in your
  window. Water it every morning, and be proud of it." (Somerset.)</p>

  <p>9. <i>Harvest Spider.</i> "The <i>harvest-man</i> has got four things
  on its back,&mdash;the scythe, the rake, the sickle, and [Query the
  fourth?] It's most unlucky for the reaper to kill it on purpose." (From
  an Essex man.)</p>

  <p>10. <i>Holly, Ivy, &amp;c.</i> "All your <i>Christmas</i> should be
  burnt on Twelfth-day morning." (London, &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>11. <i>Lettuce.</i> "O'er-much lettuce in the garden will stop a young
  wife's bearing." (Richmond, Surrey.)</p>

  <p>12. <i>May-baby.</i> "A May-baby's always sickly. You may try, but
  you'll never rear it." (Various.)</p>

  <p>13. <i>May-kitten.</i> "You should drown a May-kitten. It's unlucky to
  keep it." (Somerset.) <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page153"></a>{153}</span></p>

  <p>14. <i>New Moon.</i> "You may see as many new moons at once through a
  silk handkerchief, as there are years before you will marry."
  (Leicestershire.)</p>

  <p>15. <i>Onions.</i> "In buying onions always go in by one door of the
  shop, and come out by another. Select a shop with two doorways. These
  onions, placed under your pillow on St. Thomas's Eve, are sure to bring
  visions of your true-love, your future husband." (London, &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>16. <i>Parsley.</i> "Where parsley's grown in the garden, there'll be
  a death before the year's out. (London and Surrey.)</p>

  <p>17. <i>Ring-finger.</i> "The ring-finger, stroked along any sore or
  wound, will soon heal it. All the other fingers are poisonous, especially
  the fore-finger." (Somerset.)</p>

  <p>18. <i>Salt.</i> "Help to salt, help to sorrow." (Various.)</p>

  <p>19. <i>Three Dogs.</i> "If three dogs chase a rabbit or a hare, they
  can't kill it." (Surrey.)</p>

  <p>20. <i>White Cow.</i> "A child that sucks a white cow will thrive
  better." (Wilts.)</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Mormon Etymologies.</i>&mdash;W. Richards, "Historian and General
  Church Recorder" of the Mormons, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mormon is the name of an ancient prophet, and signifies <i>more
  good</i>. 'Mormonism,' a new coined word by the enemy, signifies <span
  class="sm">ALL TRUTH, PRESENT, PAST AND FUTURE</span>; and the 'Mormon's'
  creed is <i>the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth</i>.
  And this creed is what the devil and all his imps are eternally fighting
  against, and not against the believers of that creed only, so far as the
  <i>truth influences their actions</i>."&mdash;<i>Millenial Star</i>,
  1850, p. 341.</p>

  <p><i>Bandalore and Tommy Moore.</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What this toy was, we have no means of knowing,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Fraser's Mag.</i>, January, p. 5.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Had our reviewer stepped in at Dunnett's toy-shop, instead of
  searching all his French dictionaries, he would have learned, I doubt
  not, that bandalore is still a living toy, just as it was when Moore was
  young.</p>

  <p>At Tunbridge it is still made in their pretty ware; and sufficiently
  portable for any kind-hearted grandpapa to carry in his pocket.</p>

  <p class="author">J. J. R.</p>

  <p><i>Electric Clock.</i>&mdash;It is said that the electric telegraph
  will annihilate time and space. Of the former we have visible proof. Look
  at the new clock in West Strand. The minute-hand moves only once in each
  minute, and then it jumps a whole minute at once, and occupies a second
  of time in doing so. Now, supposing the clock to indicate true time at
  the instant of each movement, it is obvious that it must indicate untrue
  time at every other instant: hence it only indicates true time during one
  second in each minute, twenty-four minutes in each day, and six days and
  two hours in the whole year, or less than two years in a century; whilst,
  during the remaining ninety-eight years and more, it is
  <i>annihilating</i> true time, by imposing upon an unwary public that
  which is false!</p>

  <p>The same individual who has been for many years the nearest heir

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>QUERIES AS TO MR. COLLIER'S "NOTES AND EMENDATIONS."</h3>

  <p>Query 1. Does <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> claim a copyright in
  the <i>Emendations on the Text of Shakspeare</i> lately published by him,
  and derived from MS. corrections in his old copy of the folio of 1632? He
  seems to intimate as much in what he says at p. 13. of his Introduction,
  when he speaks of a certain phrase never being again seen in any edition
  of Shakspeare, "unless it be reproduced by some one who, <i>having no
  right to use the emendations of our folio 1632</i>, adheres <i>of
  necessity</i> to the <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span>antiquated blunder, and pertinaciously
  attempts to justify it."</p>

  <p>I doubt much whether he is entitled to any such privilege. If the
  words as restored were really those of Shakspeare, as is alleged, I do
  not see how the writer of the MS. corrections could <i>himself</i> claim
  any property in them; and if <i>he</i> had none, much less can <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> have. It would be a pity were the public to
  be deprived of the benefit of the corrections by the use of them being
  exclusively confined to <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span>
  editions.</p>

  <p>Query 2. Does the writer of the MS. corrections occasionally give
  reasons in support of the changes proposed? At p. 306., <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> says: "The manuscript corrector <i>assures
  us</i> that although the intention of the dramatist is evident, a decided
  misprint has crept into the line."</p>

  <p>Again, at p. 305., <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> says: "For
  'senseless obstinate,' the corrector of the folio 1632 <i>states that we
  must substitute</i> words," &amp;c. Again, at p. 352.: "A <i>note</i> in
  the folio 1632, induces us to believe that Shakspeare did not use the
  term," &amp;c. The MS. corrector is also sometimes made to tell us, that
  a certain error is the printer's, and another that of the copyist.
  Perhaps these are only rhetorical forms of expression, to intimate that
  certain corrections appeared on the margin of the folio 1632, and <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> own opinion of their propriety.</p>

<h3>HONE'S "HISTORY OF PARODY."</h3>

  <p>A small collection of the political squibs and pamphlets published by
  Wm. Hone about 1820, has lately come into my possession. An advertisement
  in several of these announces that the large material collected for his
  defence had induced him to prepare, and "very speedily" to publish, <i>A
  complete History of Parody</i>, "with extensive graphic illustrations."
  This on March 20. Again, on October 2, same year, he says: "I take this
  opportunity of announcing that the work will appear in monthly parts,
  each containing at least five engravings, and that it will probably be
  completed in eight deliveries at 5<i>s.</i> each. I pledge myself that
  the First Part shall be published, without fail, on the 1st January next,
  and respectfully invite the names of subscribers. The money to be paid on
  the delivery of each Part."</p>

  <p>Lastly, in an "Explanatory Address," appended to No. 1. of his
  <i>Every-Day Book</i>, dated 31st Dec., 1824, Hone says: "<i>The History
  of Parody</i>, with enlarged reports of my three trials, a royal 8vo.
  volume of 600 pages, handsomely printed, and illustrated by numerous
  engravings on copper and wood, plain and coloured, is in considerable
  forwardness. The price will be 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>, in extra cloth
  boards," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Thus, though advertised more than four years previously, this work had
  not yet come out, and indeed, if not mistaken, I think it never appeared
  at all. Will some of your bibliographical correspondents inform me if my
  surmise is correct? and if so, what has become of Hone's MSS., and the
  large collection he made on the subject of parody?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Lodge questions the genuineness of this letter, which appears to
  have been first published in <i>The World</i> in 1753."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I concur with Mr. Lodge. The style of the letter is quite modern: the
  verb "bully" seems also quite a modern coinage and the signature varies
  from the usual setting forth and sequence of titles contained in the
  inscriptions which the Countess placed over the gateways of her castles,
  as she repaired them, and which ran thus, the peerages being placed in
  the order of their creation, viz.: "Countess Dowager of Pembroke, Dorset,
  and Montgomery." In support of the genuineness of the letter, it may be
  urged that Sir Joseph Williamson, from an early period after the
  Restoration until 1674, when he became Secretary of State, held various
  offices about the Court that might have thus brought him into collision
  with the Countess; that he was not a very scrupulous man; that he was the
  "son of a clergyman somewhere in <i>Cumberland</i>;" and that his highest
  promotion took place before the death of the Countess in 1675. (For some
  account of him, see Evelyn's <i>Memoirs</i>, Index.) To this it may be
  added, that the letter accords with her courageous spirit. Can no earlier
  authority be given for it than that of <i>The World</i> in 1753?</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Mediæval Parchment.</i>&mdash;In what way did mediæval illuminators
  prepare their parchment? For our modern parchment is so ill prepared,
  that it gets crumpled as soon as wet chalk for gilding, or any colour, is
  laid on it; whilst the parchment in mediæval MSS. is quite smooth and
  level, as if it had not been moistened at all.</p>

  <p>Should a full answer to this Query take up too much of your valuable

  Hoping, however, that answers may still be obtained, I venture to repeat
  the questions for the <i>third</i> time, viz.:</p>

  <p>1. What was the origin of giving British regiments the <i>name</i> of
  a certain officer, instead of <i>numbering</i> them as at present?</p>

  <p>2. If in honour of an officer commanding the corps, was the name
  changed when that officer died or removed to another regiment; or what
  was the rule?</p>

  <p>3. <i>When</i> did the present mode of <i>numbering</i> regiments
  begin; and by whom was it introduced?</p>

  <p>4. What was the rule or principle laid down in giving any regiment a
  certain <i>number</i>? Was it according to the length of time it had been
  embodied?</p>

  <p>5. What is the guide now, in identifying a <i>named</i> with a
  <i>numbered</i> regiment? For example, at the battle of Culloden, in
  1746, "Wolfe's," "Barrell's," and "Howard's Foot" were engaged. Now, what
  is the rule for ascertaining the <i>numbers</i> of these, and other old
  regiments, in the British army at the present day?</p>

  <p><i>Passage in Ovid.</i>&mdash;In speaking of the rude and unscientific
  state of the early Romans, in the third book of his <i>Fasti</i>, Ovid
  has the following verses:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Libera currebant, et inobservata per annum</p>
      <p class="i1">Sidera: constabat sed tamen esse Deos.</p>
      <p>Non illi c&oelig;lo labentia signa tenebant;</p>
      <p class="i1">Sed sua: quæ magnum perdere crimen erat."</p>
      <p class="i16">V. 111-114.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The idea expressed in this passage is that the primitive Romans cared
  more about war than astronomy. They did not observe the stars, though
  they believed them to be deities. The pun upon the word
  <i>signa</i>&mdash;constellations and military standards&mdash;is worthy
  of notice. But what is the meaning of <i>libera</i>, in the first verse?
  Is it nearly equivalent to <i>inobservata</i>, and does it denote the
  absence of the prying curiosity of men? It cannot be intended that the
  courses of the stars were less regular before they were the subjects of
  observation, than after the birth of astronomy.</p>

  <p><i>Roger Pele, Abbot of Furness.</i>&mdash;Is anything known of the
  antecedents of Roger Pele, last abbot of Furness, who, after years of
  trouble and persecution, was at length constrained to execute a deed,
  dated 5th April, 28 Hen. VIII., whereby he did "freely and hollie
  surrender, giff, and graunt unto the Kynges highnes and to his heyres and
  assignes for evermore ... all his interest and titill in the said
  monasterie of ffurness, and of and in the landes, rentes, possessions,
  revenous, servyce, both spirituall and temporall," &amp;c.? This deed is,
  I believe, given at length in the Cotton MSS., Cleopatra E. IV. fol.
  244.</p>

  <p>Roger Pele was elevated about 1532, and became rector of Dalton, a
  village near his old abbey, 9th Nov., 29 Hen. VIII. This rectory he held,
  I believe, during the remainder of his life, in spite of all the efforts
  made to dispossess him. (See Beck's <i>Annales Furnessienses</i>, p. 346.
  et seq.)</p>

  <p><i>Bishop Patrick's "Parable of a Pilgrim."</i>&mdash;Can any of your

  plagiarism of Bunyan, lately attracted my attention; but I incline to the
  belief that we may still regard the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> to be as
  original as it is extraordinary. Patrick's work appears to have been
  written in 1663, while Bunyan was not committed to prison until 1660, and
  was released in 1673: having written, or at least composed, his
  extraordinary work during the interval. Bunyan might therefore have seen
  and read Patrick's book; but, from a careful comparison of the two works,
  I am satisfied in my own mind that such a supposition is unnecessary, and
  probably erroneous. I may add that Patrick honestly confesses, that not
  even his own work is entirely original, but was suggested by an elder
  "Parable of the Pilgrim" in Baker's <i>Sancta Sophia</i>.</p>

  of St. Clement (which formerly belonged to the city, and stood in the
  high road from the Temple to Westminster, but now no longer exists) are

  <p><i>Nose of Wax.</i>&mdash;In so famous a public document as the
  <i>Nottingham Declaration of the Nobles, Gentry, and Commons</i>, in
  November, 1688, against the Papistical inroads of the infatuated King
  James, I find in the Ninth Resolution that he is accused of "rendering
  the laws a <i>nose of wax</i>," in order to further arbitrary ends. I
  have often heard the phrase familiarly in my youthful days; may I ask of
  you to inform me of its origin? Its import is plain enough,&mdash;a silly
  bugbear, of none effect but to be laughed at.</p>

  <p>[Nares explains it more correctly as a proverbial phrase for anything
  very mutable and accommodating; chiefly applied to flexibility of faith.
  He adds, "It should be noticed, however, that the similitude was
  originally borrowed from the Roman Catholic writers, who applied it to
  the Holy Scriptures, on account of their being liable to various
  interpretations."]</p>

  <p>"<i>Praise from Sir Hubert Stanley!</i>"&mdash;I have somewhere heard

  it derived from the Latin <i>rogare</i>?</p>

  <p class="author">G. C. C.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Richardson derives it from Fr. <i>Rosaire</i>; Ital. and Sp.
  <i>Rosario</i>; Low Lat. <i>Rosarium, corona rosacea</i>, a garland or
  chaplet of roses. The definition of it by the Abbé Prevost is
  this:&mdash;"It consists," he says, "of fifteen tens, said to be in
  honour of the fifteen mysteries in which the Blessed Virgin bore a part.
  <i>Five</i> Joyous, viz. the annunciation, the visit to St. Elizabeth,
  the birth of our Saviour, the purification, and the disputation of Christ
  in the temple. <i>Five</i> Sorrowful: our Saviour's agony in the garden,
  his flagellation, crowning with thorns, bearing his cross, and
  crucifixion. <i>Five</i> Glorious: his resurrection, ascension, the
  descent of the Holy Ghost, his glorification in heaven, and the
  assumption of the Virgin herself."&mdash;<i>Manuel Lexique.</i> Nares,
  quoting this passage, adds, "This is good authority; but why each of the
  fives is multiplied by ten the Abbé does not explain; probably to make
  the chaplet of a sufficient length."]</p>

<h3>THE ROD: A POEM.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 493.)</p>

  <p>My copy of this poem bears date 1754, and is not stated to be a second
  edition. It has "an advertisement" of three pages, deprecatory of the
  imputation of any personal allusions, or design to encourage school
  rebellions. It has also a frontispiece ("Jas. Green, sculp., Oxon."),
  representing two youths, one standing, the other sitting, on a form; and
  before them the figure of an ass, erect on his hind legs, clothed in a
  pallium. A birch, doctorial hat, and books, lettered Priscian and <!--
  Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>Lycophron, form the base; and on a ribbon
  above is the legend, "An ass in the Greek pallium teaching." In other
  respects my copy agrees with <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley's</span>
  description of his, except that the argument (p. 7.) commences, "<i>The
  great and good</i> King Alfred," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the following lines (though I doubt their having been written
  at the age of thirteen) may be received as germane to the subject:</p>

      <p class="i4"><i>Written by a Youth of thirteen.</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Though the <i>Oak</i> be the prince and the pride of the grove,</p>
      <p>The emblem of power and the fav'rite of Jove;</p>
      <p>Though Ph&oelig;bus his temples with <i>Laurel</i> has bound,</p>
      <p>And with chaplets of <i>Poplar</i> Alcides is crown'd;</p>
      <p>Though Pallas the <i>Olive</i> has graced with her choice,</p>
      <p>And old mother Cybel in <i>Pines</i> may rejoice,</p>
      <p>Yet the Muses declare, after diligent search,</p>
      <p>That no tree can be found to compare with the <i>Birch</i>.</p>
      <p class="i1">The Birch, they affirm, is the true tree of knowledge,</p>
      <p>Revered at each school and remember'd at college.</p>
      <p>Though Virgil's famed tree might produce, as its fruit,</p>
      <p>A crop of vain dreams, and strange whims on each shoot,</p>
      <p>Yet the Birch on each bough, on the top of each switch,</p>
      <p>Bears the essence of grammar and eight parts of speech.</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Mongst the leaves are conceal'd more than mem'ry can mention,</p>
      <p>All cases, all genders, all forms of declension.</p>
      <p class="i1">Nine branches, when cropp'd by the hands of the Nine,</p>
      <p>And duly arranged in a parallel line,</p>
      <p>Tied up in nine folds of a mystical string,</p>
      <p>And soak'd for nine days in cold Helicon spring,</p>
      <p>Form a sceptre composed for a pedagogue's hand,</p>
      <p>Like the Fasces of Rome, a true badge of command.</p>
      <p>The sceptre thus finish'd, like Moses's rod,</p>
      <p>From flints could draw tears, and give life to a clod.</p>
      <p>Should darkness Egyptian, or ignorance, spread</p>
      <p>Their clouds o'er the mind, or envelope the head,</p>
      <p>The rod, thrice applied, puts the darkness to flight,</p>
      <p>Disperses the clouds, and restores us to light.</p>
      <p>Like the Virga Divina, 'twill find out the vein</p>
      <p>Where lurks the rich metal, the ore of the brain.</p>
      <p>Should Genius a captive in sloth be confined,</p>
      <p>Or the witchcraft of Pleasure prevail o'er the mind,</p>
      <p>The magical wand but apply&mdash;with a stroke</p>
      <p>The spell is dissolved, the enchantment is broke.</p>
      <p>Like Hermes' caduceus, these switches inspire</p>
      <p>Rhetorical thunder, poetical fire:</p>
      <p>And if Morpheus our temples in Lethe should steep,</p>
      <p>Their touch will untie all the fetters of sleep.</p>
      <p class="i1">Here dwells strong conviction&mdash;of Logic the glory,</p>
      <p>When applied with precision <i>à posteriori</i>.</p>
      <p>I've known a short lecture most strangely prevail,</p>
      <p>When duly convey'd to the head through the tail;</p>
      <p>Like an electrical shock, in an instant 'tis spread,</p>
      <p>And flies with a jerk from the tail to the head;</p>
      <p>Promotes circulation, and thrills through each vein,</p>
      <p>The faculties quickens, and purges the brain.</p>
      <p class="i1">By sympathy thus, and consent of the parts,</p>
      <p>We are taught, <i>fundamentally</i>, classics and arts.</p>
      <p class="i1">The Birch, <i>à priori</i>, applied to the palm,</p>
      <p>Can settle disputes and a passion becalm.</p>
      <p>Whatever disorders prevail in the blood</p>
      <p>The birch can correct them, like guaiacum wood:</p>
      <p>It sweetens the juices, corrects our ill humours,</p>
      <p>Bad habits removes, and disperses foul tumours.</p>
      <p>When applied to the hand it can cure with a switch,</p>
      <p>Like the salve of old Molyneux, used in the itch!</p>
      <p>As the famed rod of Circe to brutes could turn men,</p>
      <p>So the twigs of the Birch can unbrute them again.</p>
      <p>Like the wand of the Sybil, that branch of pure gold,</p>
      <p>These sprays can the gates of Elysium unfold&mdash;</p>
      <p>The Elysium of learning, where pleasures abound,</p>
      <p>Those sweets that still flourish on classical ground.</p>
      <p>Prometheus's rod, which, mythologists say,</p>
      <p>Fetch'd fire from the sun to give life to his clay,</p>
      <p>Was a rod well applied his men to inspire</p>
      <p>With a taste for the arts, and their genius to fire.</p>
      <p class="i1">This bundle of rods may suggest one reflection,</p>
      <p>That the arts with each other maintain a connexion.</p>
      <p>Another good moral this bundle of switches</p>
      <p>Points out to our notice and silently teaches;</p>
      <p>Of peace and good fellowship these are a token,</p>
      <p>For the twigs, well united, can scarcely be broken.</p>
      <p class="i1">Then, if such are its virtues, we'll bow to the tree,</p>

<h3>THE DUTCH EAST-INDIA COMPANY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 316.)</p>

  <p>These folio volumes appeared in 1646, without name or place of either
  author or printer, under the title&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Commencement and progress of the United Dutch Chartered East-India
  Company, containing the principal travels made among the inhabitants of
  the provinces there, together with a description of the kingdoms, courts,
  islands, rivers, roadsteads, winds, deeps, shallows, as well as
  religions, manners, character, police, and governments of the people;
  also their spices, drugs, money, and other merchandise, enriched with
  many discourses, and adorned with copperplates. Useful and profitable to
  all curious and seafaring virtuosi. With three separate tables or
  registers; divided into two parts, of which the first contains fourteen
  voyages, the most part never before published. Printed in the year
  1646.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The compiler, however, goes too far in asserting that the greatest
  part of these voyages had never been printed. The contrary appears when
  we open the folio catalogue of the Leyden Library, containing a fine
  collection of these early voyages of our ancestors.</p>

  <p>These voyages were printed consecutively in small folio before 1646;
  as also the <i>Oost Indische en West Indische Voyagien</i>, Amsterdam, by
  Michel Colyn, boekverkooper (<i>East Indian and West Indian Voyages</i>,
  Amsterdam, by Michel Colyn, bookseller), anno 1619, one volume, in the
  same form and thickness as those of 1646: some of the plates also in this
  volume are similar to those of 1646.</p>

  <p>This work was dedicated, 28th February, 1619, to the Heeren
  Gecommitteerde Raden ter Admiraliteit residerende te Amsterdam (Advising
  Committee to the Admiralty residing at Amsterdam), and begins with the
  <i>Reis naar Nova Sembla</i> (<i>Voyage to Nova Zembla</i>), printed at
  Enkhuizen in 1617, by Jacob Lenaertsz Meijn, at the Vergulde Schryfboek
  (Gilt Writing-book), so that it is not improbable that the whole work was
  printed at Enkhuizen. Michel Colyn also published other Dutch voyages in
  1622.</p>

  <p>Concerning Cornelis Claesz (<i>i.q.</i> son of Nicholas), printer at
  Amsterdam, I have to observe that he died before 1610, but that the late
  Lucas Jansz. Wagenaer had bought all his plates, maps, privileges,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>By a notarial act passed 16th August, 1610, at Enkhuizen, Tryn
  Haickesdr., widow of the above-named Wagenaer, declared that the widow of
  Cornelis Claesz might make over to Jacob Lenaertsz all the
  above-mentioned maps, privileges, &amp;c. See a resolution of the
  States-General of 13th September, 1610, in Dodt's <i>Kerkelÿk en
  Wereldlÿk Archief</i>, p. 23. (<i>Ecclesiastical and Civil
  Archives</i>).&mdash;<i>From the Navorscher.</i></p>

  <p>J. A. de Chalmot, in his <i>Biographical Dictionary of the
  Netherlands</i>, vol. vii. p. 251., names as author, or rather as
  compiler of this work, Isaak Commelin, born at Amsterdam 19th October,
  1598, died 3rd Jan. 1676, and quotes Kasp. Commelin's <i>Description of
  Amsterdam</i>, which I have not at hand to refer to. The work was printed
  at Amsterdam without printer's name: each <i>voyagie</i> or description
  is separately paged; some places have a French text. In the second volume
  is a <i>Generale beschryvinghe van Indien, &amp;c.</i>, naer de copÿe
  ghedruckt tot Batavia in de druckerÿe van Gansenpen, anno 1638
  (<i>General Description of India, &amp;c.</i>, according to the copy
  printed at Batavia at the office of the <i>Goose Quill</i>). Whether any
  other pieces which Commelin compiled had been earlier printed, I have not
  been able to discover.&mdash;<i>From the Navorscher.</i></p>

<h3>"ITS."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 509.)</p>

  <p>The following are earlier instances of the employment of <i>its</i> by
  the poets, than any that your correspondent seems to have met with:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"How sometimes nature will betray <i>its</i> folly,</p>
      <p><i>Its</i> tenderness, and makes itself a pastime</p>
      <p>To harder bosoms!</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Winter's Tale</i>, Act I. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"Each following day</p>
      <p>Became the next day's master, till the last</p>
      <p>Made former wonders <i>its</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Henry VIII.</i>, Act I. Sc. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"On the green banks which that fair stream in-bound,</p>
      <p>Flowers and odours sweetly smiled and smell'd,</p>
      <p>Which, reaching out <i>its</i> stretched arms around,</p>
      <p>All the large desert in <i>its</i> bosom held."</p>
      <p class="i1">Fairefax, <i>Godfrey of Bulloigne</i>, xviii. 20., 1600.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I doubt if there are any earlier instances among the poets. I have had
  no opportunity of examining the prose writers of the sixteenth century,
  but think they must have employed <i>its</i> earlier than the poets. As
  we may see in the version of the Bible, and other works of the time, the
  English, like the Anglo-Saxon, long continued to use the genitive
  <i>his</i> for neuters as well as for masculines; and <i>thereof</i> for
  our present <i>of it</i>, <i>its</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Its</i> leads me to reflect how ignorant people were of the old
  languages in the last century. If ever there was a palpable forgery, it
  is the Poems of Rowley: yet, if my memory does not deceive me, <!-- Page
  161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>{161}</span>Tyrwhitt
  regarded them as genuine; and Malone authoritatively affirmed that "no
  one except the nicest judges of English poetry, from Chaucer to Pope, was
  competent to test their genuineness." Why, this little word <i>its</i>
  might have tested it. You see we have not been able to trace it in poetry
  higher up than the end of the sixteenth century; and I am quite sure that
  it is not to be found in either Chaucer or Spenser: and yet, in the very
  first page of Rowley, we meet with the following instances of it:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The whyche in <i>yttes</i> felle use doe make moke dere."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The thynge <i>yttes</i> (<i>ytte is?</i>) moste bee <i>yttes</i> owne defense."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But there is a still surer test. We can hardly read a line of Chaucer,
  Gower, or any other poet of the time, without meeting with what the
  French term the feminine <i>e</i>, and which must be pronounced as a
  syllable to make the metre. From one end to the other of the Poems of
  Rowley, there is not a single instance of it!</p>

<h3>COMMENCEMENT OF THE YEAR.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 563.)</p>

  <p>It may be of service to the inquirer as to the commencement of the
  year, to call his attention to the note appended to the "Table of
  moveable Feasts" in editions prior to 1752. As given by Keeling, from the
  editions antecedent and subsequent to the last review, in 1662, they are
  as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Note.</i>&mdash;That the supputation of the year of our Lord in
  the Church of England beginneth the xxvth day of March, the same day
  supposed to be the first day upon which the world was created, and the
  day when Christ was conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary" [1604].</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Note.</i>&mdash;That the supputation of the year of our Lord in
  the Church of England beginneth the xxvth day of March" [1662].</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of course, after the act for alteration of the style (24 Geo. II. c.
  23.) was passed, this note was omitted. But up to that date the old
  supputation was authoritative and legal. Reference to Hampson's <i>Medii
  Ævi Kalendarium</i> might further illustrate the point.</p>

  <p>To this Note allow me to append a Query. After the collect for St.
  Stephen's Day follows this rubric:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Then shall follow the collect of the Nativity, which shall be said
  continually until New Year's Eve."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Query, Was this collect to be repeated from December 25 to March 24?
  for, according to the above supputation, that would be New Year's
  Eve.</p>

  <p>The following note, from the preface to Granger's <i>Biographical
  History</i>, may not be out of place:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The following absurdities, among many others, were occasioned by
  these different computations. In 1667 there were two Easters, the first
  on the 25th of April, and the second on the 22nd of March following; and
  there were three different denominations of the Year of our Lord affixed
  to three state papers which were published in one week, viz. his
  Majesty's Speech, dated 1732-3; the Address of the House of Lords, 1732;
  the Address of the House of Commons, 1733."&mdash;Page xxiii., edit.

<h3>"PENARDO AND LAISSA."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 84.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent E. D. is fortunate in the possession of a rare
  book, worth a "jew's eye" in the good old days of the Bibliomania. It
  formed a part of the Heber Collection, where (see Part iv. p. 111.) it
  figures under the following quaint title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The First Booke of the Famous Historye of Penardo and Laissa,
  other-ways called the Warres of Love and Ambitione, wherein is described
  Penardo his most admirable deeds of Arms, his ambition of glore, his
  contempt of love, with loves mighte assalts and ammorous temptations,
  Laissa's feareful inchantment, hir relief, hir travells, and lastly,
  loves admirabel force in hir releiving Penardo from the fire. Doone in
  Heroik Verse by Patrik Gordon.</p>

  <p>Printed at Dort by George Waters, 1615."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This copy, which was originally John Pinkerton's, cost Mr. Heber
  21<i>l.</i>, and was resold at his sale for 12<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>, for
  the library of Mr. Miller, of Craigentenny; another is in the possession
  of Dr. Keith, Edinburgh. Pinkerton, in his <i>Ancient Scottish Poems</i>,
  London, 1792, thus describes <i>Penardo and Laissa</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Rare to excess; nor can more than two copies be discovered, one in
  the editor's possession, another in that of an anonymous correspondent in
  Scotland. The author was probably so ashamed of it as to quash the
  edition, for it is the most puerile mixture of all times, manners, and
  religions that ever was published; for instance, the Christian religion
  is put as that of Ancient Greece."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of the author, Patrick Gordon, little or nothing seems to be known
  beyond the fact of his styling himself "gentleman," probably the only
  ground for Pinkerton calling him "a man of property." The fame of Gordon,
  however, rests upon a better foundation than the above work, he having
  also "doone in heroik verse <i>The Famous Historie of the Renouned and
  Valiant Prince Robert, surnamed the Bruce, King of Scotland</i>," "a
  tolerable poem," says the same critic, "but not worth reprinting,
  although it had that compliment twice paid to it." <!-- Page 162 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span></p>

  <p>The "Bruce" of our author is a concoction from Barbour and a certain
  <i>Book of Virgin Parchment</i>, upon the same subject, by Peter Fenton,
  known only to Gordon, and, like <i>Penardo</i>, sets propriety at
  defiance, "Christ and Jupiter being with matchless indecorum grouped
  together:"<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> it,
  too, came originally from the press of Dort, 1615; again from that of
  James Watson, Edinburgh, 1718; and a third time, Glasgow, by Hall,
  1753.</p>

<h3>ROBIN HOOD.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 597.)</p>

  <p>Ireland, too, is associated with the fame of this renowned
  wood-ranger. This "<i>pen</i><span class="nw">-ultima</span> Thule,"
  which received and protected the refugees of Roman oppression and the
  victims of Saxon extermination, was looked to in later times as a
  sanctuary where crime might evade punishment; and in the <i>Annals of
  Robin Hood</i> this national commiseration was evinced.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the year 1189," writes Holinshed, "there ranged three robbers and
  outlaws in England, among which 'Robert' Hood and Little John were
  chieftains, of all thieves doubtless the most courteous. Robert, being
  betrayed at a nunnery in Scotland, called Bricklies, the remnant of the
  'crue' was scattered, and every man forced to shift for himself;
  whereupon Little John was fain <i>to flee the realm</i> by sailing into
  Ireland, where he sojourned for a few days at Dublin. The citizens being
  'doone' to understand the wandering outcast to be an excellent archer,
  requested him heartily to try how far he could shoot at random, who,
  yielding to their behest, stood on the bridge of Dublin and shot to a
  hillock in Oxmantown (thereafter called Little John's shot), leaving
  behind him a monument, rather by posterity to be wondered than possibly
  by any man living to be counterscored."&mdash;<i>Description of
  Ireland</i>, fol., p. 24.</p>

  <p>The danger, however, of being taken drove Little John thence to
  Scotland, where, adds the annalist, "he died at a town or village called
  Moravie."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John D'Alton.</span></p>

  <p>I may perhaps be allowed to subscribe to the opinion expressed by H.
  K., that "though men of the name of Robin Hood may have existed in
  England, that of itself could afford no ground for inferring that some
  one of them was the Robin Hood of romantic tradition;" and at the same
  time to express my dissent from the conclusion, that "any pretence for
  such a supposition is taken away by the strong evidence, both Scotch and
  French," which H. K. has "adduced in support of the opposite view."</p>

  <p>The inferences which I draw from the facts adduced by H. K. are, that
  the fame of the hero of English ballads probably extended to France and
  Scotland, and that the people of Scotland probably sympathised with this
  disturber of the peace of the kingdom of their "aulde ennemies."</p>

  <p>I must, however, confess that I have not met with any portion of "the
  discussion about the nature of Robin Hood," excepting that contained in
  Ritson's Notes and Hunter's Tract, and that the evidence adduced in the
  latter publication, in support of the tradition handed down to us in the
  ballad entitled <i>A Lyttel Geste of Robyn Hode</i>, seems to me to
  satisfactorily show that "the Robin Hood of romantic tradition really
  existed in England in the time of Edward II."</p>

  <p><i>Originator of Collodion Process</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 47. 92.
  116.).&mdash;The fairest way of deciding M. Le Gray's claims would be, to
  quote what he really says.</p>

  <p>Willat's pamphlet, published in 1850, entitled <i>A Practical
  Treatise, &amp;c.</i>, by Gustave Le Gray, translated by Thomas Cousins,
  ends with an appendix, which runs thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have just discovered a process upon glass by hydrofluoric ether,
  the fluoride of potassium, and soda dissolved in alcohol 40°, mixed with
  sulphuric ether, and afterwards saturated with collodion; I afterwards
  re-act with aceto-nitrate of silver, and thus obtain proofs in the camera
  in five seconds in the shade. I develope the image by a very weak
  solution of sulphate of iron, and fix with hyposulphite of soda. I hope
  by this process to arrive at great rapidity. Ammonia and bromide of
  potassium give great variations of promptitude. As soon as my experiments
  are complete I will publish the result in an appendix. This application
  upon glass is very easy: the same agents employed with albumen and
  dextrine, give also excellent results and very quick. I have also
  experimented with a mucilage produced by a fucus, a kind of sea-weed,
  which promises future success. I hope by some of these means to succeed
  in taking portraits in three or four seconds."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I know not at what time of the year the pamphlet came out, nor whether
  the appendix was subsequently added; but any copy containing it was
  bought about the middle of August, 1850.</p>

  <p>[We have much pleasure in inserting this communication, as it may be

  <p><i>The Soiling of the Fingers</i> may be entirely avoided by a simple

  levelled stand and developed, proceed thus: instead of holding the plate
  by the fingers to perform the subsequent processes, take a strip of glass
  (say five inches long and one and a half wide for the ordinary portrait
  size), put a single drop of water on it, and carefully pass it beneath
  the developed plate; lift the glass thereby; the adhesion is sufficiently
  firm to sustain the plate in any required position for the remaining
  manipulations till it is washed and finished.</p>

  <p><i>The Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;Absence from London has prevented

  class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> has used my name in connexion with the
  collodion process. He states that he called several times, and made me
  familiar with the process; by which he would lead persons to suppose that
  he taught me in fact to take pictures. Now I beg most distinctly to state
  that this is incorrect. <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> made, it is
  true, several attempts in my glass room to take a picture, but totally
  failed. And why? Because he attempted to follow out the process as he
  himself had published it. From that time I worked it out by myself,
  assisted by hints from Mr. Fry, who at the time I allude to was a
  successful manipulator, and had produced and exhibited many beautiful
  pictures, and at whose suggestion I commenced it in the first
  instance.</p>

  <p><i>Portable Camera</i> (Vol. vii., p. 71.).&mdash;If India rubber
  should turn out to be what H. Y. W. N. thinks he has found it to be, it
  would be capable of being turned to excellent account. For instance,
  instead of having a single "portable camera," which is on many accounts
  very awkward to use, why should not the tourist have a light framework
  constructed, and covered entirely with this India rubber: in fact, an
  India rubber box, in which his camera, and a partitioned shelf containing
  his collodion, developing fluid, hypo-soda solution, &amp;c., might be
  easily packed, and in which, by the aid of sleeves, &amp;c., he might
  coat his plates, and develop and fix them, quite apart from his camera?
  He <i>must</i> have <i>something</i> to pack his camera, &amp;c. in; and
  the above-described packing-case would be very light, and also
  waterproof.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Chaplains to Noblemen</i> (Vol. vii., p. 85.).&mdash;The statute in
  which chaplains to noblemen are first named is 21 Henry VIII. c. 13.
  (1529); in which, by sect. 11., it is enacted, "that every Archbysshop
  and Duke may have vj chapleyns;" "every Markes and Erle may have fyve
  chapleyns;" "every vycecount and other Byshop may have foure chapleyns;"
  and "the Chancellour of England for the tyme beying and every Baron or
  Knyght of the Garter may have thre chapleyns:" and one chaplain of each
  order, whether Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, is thereby
  authorised to purchase "lycence or dispensacion to take, receyve, and
  kepe two parsonages or benefices with cure of souls" (<i>Stat. of the
  Realm</i>, vol. iii. p. 294.). I believe that X. will find a regular
  registry of these appointments in Doctors' Commons.</p>

  <p>It may be interesting to add, that among the other persons named in
  this statute are the Master of the Rolls, who may have "two chapleyns;"
  and the "Chefe Justice of the Kinges Benche," who may have "one
  chapleyn." By another statute, 25 Henry VIII. c. 16. (1533-4), this last
  power to have one chaplain is extended to "every Jugge of the seid high
  courtes" (King's Bench and Common Pleas), "the Chaunceller and Cheffe
  Baron of the Exchequer, the kynges generall attorney and generall
  soliciter" (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 457.)</p>

  evidence, or exhausted my sources of inquiry. The communication of <span
  class="sc">Whunside</span> is the first direct testimony, and may settle
  the Fawcett case. As he was "resident at Mr. Fawcett's when the

  and place of the conviction, and the name of the convict. By adding his
  own name, the facts will stand upon his authority.</p>

  <p><i>Brydone the Tourist</i> (Vol. vii., p. 108.).&mdash;A. B. C.
  inquires the birthplace of Brydone, "the tourist and author." I presume
  he refers to Patrick Brydone, who wrote <i>Travels in Sicily and
  Malta</i>, and who held, I believe, an appointment under the
  Commissioners of Stamps, and died about thirty years ago. Some
  four-and-twenty years back, I arrived, late in the evening, at the
  hospitable cottage of Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, at Altrieve, in the
  vale of Yarrow. It happened to be, as it often was, too full of guests to
  afford me a bed; and I was transferred by my host to the house of a
  neighbouring gentleman, where I slept. That gentleman was Mr. Brydone, of
  Mount Benger, <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  the tourist, whose birthplace was in the Forest of Ettrick.</p>

  facts. Our transatlantic brethren do <i>not</i>, either willingly or
  unwillingly, adopt <i>Yankee</i> as their "collective name."
  <i>Yankee</i> was, and is, a name given exclusively to the natives of the
  New England States, and was never therefore applied, by an American, to
  the people of New Amsterdam or New York. Here, in England, indeed, we are
  accustomed to call all Americans <i>Yankees</i>; which is about the same
  thing as to call all Englishmen Devonians or Lancastrians.</p>

  <p><i>Miniature Ring of Charles I.</i> (Vol. vi., p. 578.).&mdash;One of
  the four rings inquired for is in the possession of Mrs. Andrew
  Henderson, of 102. Gloucester Place, Portman Square, formerly Miss
  Adolphus. It came to her in the female line, through her mother's family.
  The unfortunate Charles I. presented it to Sir Lionel Walden, on the
  morning on which he lost his life. It bears (as the other one alluded to
  in Hulbert's <i>History of Salop</i>) a miniature likeness of the king,
  set in small brilliants. Inside the ring are the words, "Sic transit
  gloria regum." Mrs. Henderson understood the four rings to have been
  presented as follows:&mdash;Bishop Juxon, Sir Lionel Walden, Colonel
  Ashburnham, and Herbert his secretary. Which of the four is now in the
  possession of the Misses Pigott is not mentioned.</p>

  <p><i>Bishop of Ossory&mdash;Cardinal's Hat</i> (Vol. vii., p.

  all prelates, and that the distinction is only in the number of the
  tassels to the hat-strings; but I think he is wrong in attributing the
  hat to <i>priors</i>. I believe it only belonged to <i>abbots</i>, who
  had <i>black</i> hats and tassels; while the colour of the prelatical
  hats and tassels was green. (See Père Anselme's <i>Palais d'Honneur</i>,

  City of Exeter</i>; and also Burke's <i>Armory</i>, under the name
  <i>Oldom</i>.) I have endeavoured to find some pedigree or particulars of
  his family, but as yet without success. The following Notes from what I
  have collected may, however, assist J. B. in his inquiries. He was of
  Queen's College, Cambridge, and chaplain to the Countess of Richmond
  (King Henry VII.'s mother), and by her interest was installed Bp. of
  Exeter, April 3, 1507. He was a great benefactor to Brazenose College,
  Oxford, and joint founder (with Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester) of
  Corpus Christi. He also founded and endowed a school at Manchester, for
  educating boys in good and useful literature. He died June 25, 1523,
  under sentence of excommunication, in consequence of an action at law
  then pending between him and the Abbot of Tavistock; but the Pope's
  sanction being obtained, he was buried in a chapel built expressly for
  the purpose, at the upper end of the south aisle of his own
  cathedral.</p>

  Fitz-Adam, Thursday, January 4, 1753, begins with the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>After relating the sudden restoration of his faculties, "Fitz-Adam"
  proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But, as if the blessings of this life were only given us for

  <p>"<i>Nine Tailors make a Man</i>" (Vol. vi., pp. 390. 563.).&mdash;I
  extract the following humorous account of the origin of this saying from
  <i>The British Apollo</i> (12mo., reprint of 1726, vol. i. p. 236.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It happen'd ('tis no great matter in what year) that eight taylors,
  having finish'd considerable pieces of work at a certain person of
  quality's house (whose name authors have thought fit to conceal), and
  receiving all the money due for the same, a virago servant maid of the
  house observing them to be but slender-built animals, and in their
  mathematical postures on their shop-board appearing but so many pieces of
  men, resolv'd to encounter and pillage them on the road. The better to
  compass her design, she procured a very terrible great black-pudding,
  which (having waylaid them) she presented at the breast of the foremost:
  they, mistaking this prop of life for an instrument of death, at least a
  blunder-buss, readily yielded up their money; but she, not contented with
  that, severely disciplin'd them with a cudgel she carry'd in the other
  hand, all which they bore with a philosophical resignation. Thus, eight
  not being able to deal with one woman, by consequence could not make a
  man, on which account a ninth is added. 'Tis the opinion of our curious
  virtuosos, that this want of courage ariseth from their immoderate eating
  of cucumbers, which too much refrigerates their blood. However, to their
  eternal honour be it spoke, they have been often known to encounter a
  sort of cannibals, to whose assaults they are often subject, not
  fictitious, but real man-eaters, and that with a lance but two inches
  long; nay, and although they go arm'd no further than their

  <p><i>On Quotations</i> (Vol. vi., p. 408.).&mdash;There can be no doubt

  the quoter's purpose, of which I believe the following to be an instance.
  We frequently meet with the quotation, "Nullum numen <i>abest</i>, si sit
  prudentia," with a reference to Juvenal. I have not been able to find the
  passage in this shape, and presume it is an alteration from the address
  to Fortune, which occurs twice in his <i>Satires</i>, Sat. x. v. 365,
  366., and Sat. xiv. v. 315, 316.:</p>

  bottom of the haven by fyve fote, and there they found a ball of sande
  nigh a fote thick, and that dyd lye uppon a spring of sand neere three
  fote thick, and that dyd lye uppon a bed of clay, the thicknesse thereof
  could not be known. And there, uppon Monday nexte after the feast of St.
  John Baptist, was layd the first stone, and that stone layd Dame Margaret
  Tylney, and thereuppon layd she v<i>l.</i> sterling. The nexte stone was
  layd by S<sup>r</sup> John Tattersall, prson of Boston, who layd down
  thereuppon v<i>l.</i> sterling. And Richard Stevenson, merchant of the
  Staple, layd the third stone, and thereuppon v<i>l.</i> sterling. And
  these were all the great guifts that at that time were given thereunto.

  <p><i>Etymology of Pearl</i> (Vol. vi., p. 578.; Vol. vii., p.
  18.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Sir Emerson Tennent</span> inquires as to
  the antiquity of the word <i>pearl</i> in the English language.
  <i>Pærl</i> occurs in Anglo-Saxon (Bosworth in v.), and corresponding
  forms are found in the Scandinavian languages, as well as in the Welsh
  and Irish. The old German form of the word is <i>berille</i>. Richardson
  in v. quotes an instance of the adjective <i>pearled</i> from Gower, who
  belongs to the fourteenth century. The use of <i>union</i> for
  <i>pearl</i>, cited by <span class="sc">Sir E. Tennent</span> from
  Burton, is a learned application of the word, and never was popular in
  our language.</p>

  <p>I may add that Muratori inserts the word <i>perla</i> in the
  <i>Italian Glossary</i>, in his 33rd Dissertation on Italian Mediæval
  Antiquities. He believes the origin of the word to be Teutonic, but
  throws no light on the subject. It appears from Halliwell's <i>Arch. and
  Prov. Dictionary</i>, that white spots in the eyes were anciently called
  <i>pearls</i>. M&lsquo;Culloch, <i>Commercial Dictionary</i> in v.,
  particularly speaks of the pear-shaped form of the pearl; and, on the
  whole, the supposition that <i>perula</i> is equivalent to
  <i>pear-ling</i>, seems the most probable.</p>

  properly spelt on the seal of the ancient priory, is situated, receive
  their etymologies from local or geological distinctions. Folkeston forms
  no exception to the general rule. The soil consists of a most beautiful
  yellow sand, such as the <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  become a family prenomen, as in Fulke-Greville, Fulk-Brooke; in other
  terms, the yellow Greville or yellow Brook; and Folkeston is nothing more
  than the yellow town, so called from the nature of the soil on which it
  is built.</p>

  candidate for the degree of B.C.L. should have passed his examination for
  the degree of B.A., and attended one course of lectures with the Regius
  Professor of Civil Law. In the case of particular colleges, twenty terms
  must have been kept: by members of other colleges, twenty-four terms must
  have been completed. The examination is upon the four books, or any part
  of them, of the <i>Institutes of Justinian</i>, or works which serve to
  illustrate them in the science of civil law, of which six months' notice
  is previously given by the Regius Professor.</p>

  <p>At Cambridge, a B.A. of four years' standing can be admitted LL.B. The
  candidate must have passed the previous examination; attended the

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The Camden Society has, after a long silence, just issued a volume,
  <i>The Camden Miscellany, Volume the Second</i>, which from the variety
  and interest of its contents, cannot but be acceptable to all the
  members. These contents are, I. <i>Account of the Expenses of John of
  Brabant, and Henry and Thomas of Lancaster, 1292-93.</i>&mdash;II.
  <i>Household Account of the Princess Elizabeth, 1551-52.</i>&mdash;III.
  <i>The Bequeste and Suite of a True-hearted Englishman, written by
  William Cholmeley, 1553.</i>&mdash;IV. <i>Discovery of the Jesuits'
  College at Clerkenwell in March, 1627-28.</i>&mdash;V. <i>Trelawny
  Papers.</i>&mdash;VI. <i>Autobiography of William Taswell, D. D.</i>
  This, which is the first book for the year 1852-53, will be immediately
  followed by a volume of <i>Verney Papers</i>, editing by Mr. Bruce; and
  this probably by <i>The Domesday of St. Paul's</i>, editing by Archdeacon
  Hale, or <i>The Correspondence of Lady Brilliana Harley</i>, editing by
  the Rev. T. T. Lewis. Early in the ensuing Camden year, which commences
  on the 1st of May, two volumes of considerable interest may be looked
  for, namely, <i>The Roll of the Household Expenses of Richard Swinfield,
  Bishop of Hereford, in the years 1289-90, with illustrations from other
  and coeval Documents</i> by the Rev. John Webb; and <i>Regulæ Inclusarum,
  The Ancren Rewle, A Treatise on the Rules and Duties of Monastic Life,
  addressed to a Society of Anchorites by Simon of Ghent</i>, a work
  valuable for philology, for it is written in the semi-Saxon dialect of
  the thirteenth century, and curious for its illustration of ancient
  manners. It will be accompanied by a translation by the Rev. James
  Morton, the editor.</p>

  <p><i>The Architectural, Archæological, and Historic Society for the
  County, City, and Neighbourhood of Chester</i>, has just published the
  Second Part of its Journal, in which objects of local interest are made
  available for much instructive information; and to accomplish which the
  conductors have, and as we think wisely, preferred a great number of apt
  illustrations, executed without any pretence to artistic skill, to a
  <i>few</i> expensive and highly-finished engravings.</p>

  <p>Our Dutch neighbours seem to enjoy as much as ourselves the humour of
  Charles Dickens. Not only is <i>Bleak House</i> regularly translated as
  it appears, but in a bookseller's circular which has just reached us, we
  see announced translations of the <i>Sketches by Boz</i>, and of a
  <i>Selection from Household Words</i>.</p>

  <p>There is much tact required in writing for children, and no small
  share of this is exhibited in a <i>History of France for Children</i>,
  which Viscount Cranborne has just compiled for the use of his nieces. The
  principal events are brought forward in succession, and related in a
  plain, unaffected style, well calculated for youthful readers.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Joan of Arc, by Lord
  Mahon</i>, the new number of Murray's <i>Railway Library</i>, is a
  reprint, from the noble author's <i>Historical Essays</i>, of his careful
  summary of Joan's extraordinary history.&mdash;<i>Cyclopædia
  Bibliographica, a Library Manual of Theological and General
  Literature</i>, the fifth part of Mr. Darling's most useful guide for
  authors, preachers, students, and literary men.&mdash;<i>Synodalia, a
  Journal of Convocation</i>, Nos. 1. to 4.; four parts of a monthly
  periodical, instituted not so much for the purpose of securing
  immediately synodical action in the Church, as with the view of preparing
  the public mind for its reception.&mdash;<i>Ferdinand I. and Maximilian
  II. of Austria, or a view of the Religion and Political State of Germany
  after the Reformation.</i> An able and instructive essay by Professor Von
  Ranke, well translated for <i>Longman's Traveller's Library</i> by Sir A.
  and Lady Duff Gordon.&mdash;<i>Kidd's Own Journal for January, 1853</i>.
  The new number of a journal which deserves the notice of all lovers of
  natural history and keepers of pets.&mdash;<i>Remains of Pagan Saxondom,
  principally from Tumuli in England</i>, by J. Y. Akerman; Part III.,
  containing <i>Beads, Crystal Ball, and Bulla</i> from Breach Down, and
  <i>Glass Vase</i> from Cuddesden, drawn of their original size and
  coloured.</p>

<p class="ac">CONSTITUTION.</p>

  <p>The Athenæum Institute is legally incorporated as a Mutual Benefit
  Society, and the rank and public status of its Vice-Presidents, Honorary
  Directors, Trustee, and Treasurer, and the well-known character of its
  business Directors, present a security to Authors, Journalists, and all
  connected with Literature, that it is based on sound principles, and will
  be conducted with fidelity and honour.</p>

  <p>It consists of two classes of Supporters.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>Non-Participating or Honorary Subscribers</i>, who, it is hoped,
  may include <span class="sc">The Royal Family</span> and great Officers
  of the state, on account of the political and moral influences of
  Authors; <span class="sc">Noblemen</span> and <span class="sc">Men of
  Fortune</span> who have manifested a marked predilection for Literature;
  <span class="sc">Authors of Fortune</span> and others sympathising with,
  and interested in the labours of literary men.</p>

  <p><i>Participating Subscribers</i>, consisting of <span
  class="sc">Professional Authors</span>, and that large mass of writers
  who produce the current literature of the age in Works of Science,
  Imagination, Education, and the Periodical and Newspaper Press of the
  Empire.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Constitution of the Society is such that the general body of its
  members hold the directing power. The Board of Business Directors is
  elected by it, and their powers and duties, as well as those of the
  officers, are clearly defined by the laws and rules of the Institute,
  which are in strict conformity with the elaborate requirements of the
  Friendly Societies' Act (14th and 15th Victoria, chap. 115.).</p>

  <p><span class="sc">The Qualification of Membership</span> is authorship
  in some shape, but a large and liberal will be the most just
  interpretation of the term. As close a definition as can be given perhaps
  is, that it intends to include all who use the pen with an intellectual
  aim, women as well as men. The printed forms (which can be had on
  application) will show more minutely what is required to constitute
  membership.</p>

<p class="ac">REVENUE.</p>

  <p>The distinguishing feature of the Institute is its applying the
  principle of Life Assurance in all its transactions.</p>

  <p>The <i>Subscriptions</i> of the <i>Honorary Subscribers</i> are
  applied to an Assurance of the Life of the Donors.</p>

  <p>For instance,&mdash;The Right Honourable Benjamin Disraeli, Esq.,
  sends a Donation of Twenty-five Pounds, which is immediately invested on
  an Assurance on his life, and will ultimately produce to the Institute an
  Endowment of 42<i>l.</i> Or to take another instance,&mdash;The Right
  Hon. Lord Viscount Goderich subscribes Two Guineas per year, which is
  invested in like manner on an Assurance on his life, and will ultimately
  Endow the Institute with 100<i>l.</i> And thus the Honorary
  Subscriptions, instead of being spent as soon as received, are made to
  form a Capital Fund, which will be ultimately available, as the Lives
  fall in, to the Provident Members and Participating Subscribers.</p>

  <p>The application of the subscriptions of the Honorary Members to
  assuring their lives, has these advantages:&mdash;It tends to create a
  large capital fund&mdash;It enables the Honorary subscribers to see that
  the undertaking is successful, before their money is expended&mdash;It
  transforms such subscriptions from being an alms-giving for personal
  purposes, into an Endowment for the general benefit of
  Literature&mdash;It is not like most alms subscriptions to go in casual
  relief, but to produce a permanent result; such as the foundation of a
  Hall and chambers, and ultimately the complete organisation of Literature
  as a recognised profession; to endow permanent annuities, and otherwise
  aid Literature by succouring Authors.</p>

  <p>By this arrangement a very strong inducement is given to the Working
  Literary Men to subscribe to this Institute and Society beyond all
  others: as they will not only have all the benefits and profits arising
  from their own subscriptions, but participate in the Capital Fund, which,
  there can be no doubt, will be augmented by Donations, Legacies, and
  Endowments. There is also the special advantage peculiar to such an
  Institution, of <span class="sm">NOMINATING A WIFE OR CHILD</span> to
  receive immediately the Amount <span class="sm">ASSURED</span> at decease
  <span class="sm">IRRESPECTIVE OF ALL OTHER CLAIMS</span>.</p>

  <p><i>The Subscriptions of the Participating Class</i> are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="sc">One Guinea</span> must be subscribed by every member,
  which goes towards the expenses of the Institute and the support of the
  Philanthropic Fund. For this he is entitled to be a candidate for
  assistance from the Philanthropic Fund; has a Vote at all the General
  Meetings of the Institute; and will be entitled to certain benefits from
  the Education and Protective Branches of the Institute when they are
  brought into operation.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Every Guinea subscribed annually</span> <i>beyond</i>
  the first Guinea above mentioned, produces the Subscriber an Assurance on
  his life, according to the Tables specially calculated by the Consulting
  Actuary of the Institute, and which are in compliance with the Act of
  Parliament regulating such matters. The Policies are issued by the
  Institute under the Friendly Societies' Act, and which are legally
  guaranteed by the Athenæum Life Assurance Society, which, also appealing
  more particularly to Literary and Scientific Men, has made an arrangement
  that is liberal and advantageous to the Athenæum Institute.</p>

  <p>By this arrangement every Provident Member is equally safe, whether
  the members of the Institute be few or many.</p>

  <p>One Subscriber is thus rendered as secure as a thousand.</p>

  <p>Annual Subscribers of Two Guineas or more are entitled to become
  Directors: and in awarding relief, regard will always be had to the
  amount subscribed.</p>

  <p>It will be perceived by these arrangements, that every member of the
  Athenæum Institute has the full value returned to him of <i>every</i>
  Guinea subscribed <i>beyond</i> the first, in a Policy on his life; and
  that he also has a participation in the Capital Fund formed by the
  Subscriptions, Donations, and Endowments of the Honorary Subscribers; a
  privilege which it is probable will add from fifty to a hundred per cent.
  to his individual contributions.</p>

  <p>The Friendly Societies' Act, under which the Institute is registered,
  will not permit a member to make an Assurance beyond 100<i>l.</i>, the
  Institute is therefore limited to this amount: but the Athenæum Life
  Assurance Society, which so liberally assists the Institute, will insure
  to any amount, and in any mode. It is desirable that the members of the
  Institute should assure up to the 100<i>l.</i> allowed by the Act, and
  the Tables will shew the annual amount required, according to the Age of
  the Subscriber. The power of <span class="sm">NOMINATING A WIFE OR
  CHILD</span>, irrespective of all other claimants, is also a great
  inducement to assure in the Institute to the utmost amount, namely,
  100<i>l.</i></p>

  <p>It is contemplated, as the Institute progresses, to add <span
  class="sc">Protective</span> and <span class="sc">Educational</span>
  Branches.</p>

  <p>The union of numbers has established the various Commercial and
  Philanthropic Institutions of the Empire, and it is earnest urged that
  Authors and Journalists should take advantage of their numbers. Nothing
  can be accomplished without numbers&mdash;with them everything. The
  appeal now made is universal in its application to Literary workers, and
  it is hoped it will be responded to so as to neutralise all cliquism,
  whether arising from literary sectarianism, or the antagonism of
  political sentiments.</p>
